- Scanner Class: ============================================================================

	***Scanner class is used to "retrieve user input from keyboard" and use it in our code

	-How to implement Scanner:

		//1. Create Scanner object
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); => for now, just memorize it with this syntax

		//2. Ask user to enter any info
		System.out.println("please enter any type of data:");

		//3. Assign user input into a variable after capturing it with appropriate methods of Scanner Object
		DataType variableName = sc.next...();

		  int age = sc.nextInt(); => Integer value

		  int firstname = sc.next();  	=> String as "only one word" - with no space
		  int fullName  = sc.nextLine();=> String as "one word" or "more than one word" and
		  															also captures "Enter" key
